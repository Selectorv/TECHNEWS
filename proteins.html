            <h3>You are what you eat! Body organs like skin, hair, nails and joints are the first organs that can reveal your body health
                from afar and <span>protein</span> nutrients revolves around this vital body organs.

            </h3><br>
            <p> Quick result can also be achieved by using different products and supplements from the market or stores.
                Creating home made products from organic materials is also another way you can achieve your result, but nutritionist 
                and scientists recommend getting the nutrition value and compounds through sufficient diet.
               
           </p><br>

            <p>Protein rich foods  are mostly found in meat, fish, dairy product,<a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutriton/a20706575/healthy-whole-grains/"> 
                grains</a>, and beans.

       <div class="content">
        <p> Not all protein rich foods contain 
            the same level of protein nutrients. Consider increasing protein meals rich in <span>collagen</span>.
            
            What is collagen? Collagen is any of more than 28 types of <span>glycoprotein</span> that form elongated fibers, usually found in the
            extracellular matrix of <span>connective tissue</span> which binds other tissue systems or organs such as hair, nails, skin, joints and also
                gum.</p> 
      



        <p>The connective tissue consists of three elements cells, fibers and extracellular matrix which provide support to the body
            organs.
           </p>
           <p>Collagen contains a compound known as <span>glycogen</span> which is a nonessential amino acid which the body provides itself.
            Unfortunately the body does not provide enough of it and human is required to find it from other source. Scientifically studied 
            protein rich food with high level of collagen are beef liver and organs, sea fish, chicken skin and bone broth which has the superior quantity of collagen.

        </p>  


        <h2>What is Bone broth?</h2>
          
       <p>Bone broth is a soup made from simmering or boiling bones from animals. Vinegar, lemon and tomatoes can be used to remove nutrients 
        that are required from the bones. Apart from protein's compound collagen; bone broth has other essential minerals that human body requires 
        <p>1. Calcium</p> 
        <p>2. Potassium </p>
        <p>3. Iron</p>
        <P>4. Phosphorus</P>
        <p>5. Sodium</p>
        <p>6. Copper</p>
       </p>


       <p>Let's look at how collagen from bone broth affects your hair, nails and skin</p>

        <h3>Healthy Nourished Hair</h3> 
        <p>Nourished hair is silky, smooth with healthy pigment and all of this is formed from the root of the hair 
            follicle of the skin which is made of protein nutrients. Not all protein nutrients have essential nutrients that 
            compose healthy hair. Bone broth has a protein compound known as <span>Keratin</span> which the hair is composed.<br><br>
            Keratin is produced naturally by the body but it does not provide enough of it and also reduces drastically with ageing
            so it is advised to increase this protein intake when ageing.<br><br>
            A collagen ollagen compound which acts as antioxidant fights hydrogen peroxide which contributes to premature graying of hair,
             breaking and loss of hair are symptoms caused by lack of keratin. Although keratin can be found from 
            manufactured and home made products which you can apply directly on the hair as the remedy of collagen deficiency,
            it's very useful for you to consume the natural food for good and long time result.
            
        
            
        </p> 

        <h3>Reduces ageing of the skin</h3> 
        <p>Collagen deficiency contributes to wrinkles and reduction of skin elasticity which are signs of ageing. Daily intake of bone
            broth per day can slow down wrinkles by the compounds formed from amino acid which is the remedy of skin elasticity, hydration
            and improve on healthy melanin of the skin.
            Bone broth also heals wounds and helps the blood to clot. </p> 
        
        <h3>Healthy nails</h3>
        <p>Peeling, dry, cracked and brittle nails all are signs of nutrition  deficiency. Nails should be strong, shiny and grow 
            at least 2mm to 3mm per month. Collagen nutrients and other minerals like calcium from bone broth can be a good help if you need long time solution. 
        </p>

        <h3>Strengthen muscles and bones </h3>
        <p>Joint pain or osteoporosis disease which the bones become extremely subject to fracture occurring especially in older women
             is due to decrease in collagen nutrients.

                        when you are suffering from any renal disease which really require doctors' attention or medical advice.
