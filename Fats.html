                            digestive system consists of small projections called <span>villus</span> which require lubrication for easy and smooth digestion,
                            This villus may experience friction during food digestion which leads them to be worn out thus leading to bloating, excessive gas and rambling
                             of the stomach leading to one's discomfort. You can avoid this by consuming fats. </p>
